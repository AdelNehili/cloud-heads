Minikube section:
1. Port Verification
    1. Ensure that the Flask code uses port 5000 (default port).
    2. Ensure that the Docker container, containing app.py, exposes port 5000.
    3. Ensure that the deployment, containing the Docker image, communicates through port 5000.
    4. Ensure that the LoadBalancer service listens on port 80 (default web port) and communicates with port 5000.

2. Verification of Minikube (The mini "environment" that allows easy Kubernetes running)
    1. Install Minikube: `./temp/bash_install_k8s.sh`
    2. Build the Docker and load it onto Minikube: `./bash_test_kubectl.sh load`
        2.1. Verify that the Minikube environment has our Docker image (in one command line): `minikube ssh -- "docker images"`
            2.1.1. Or manually by connecting to the Minikube terminal: `minikube ssh`
            2.1.2. And displaying the images: `docker images`
    3. Activate Minikube: `minikube start`
    4. On ANOTHER TERMINAL, activate the tunnel allowing the LoadBalancer to access the web page: `minikube tunnel`
        4.1. Make SURE that the tunnel no longer requires admin access (asks for the password).

3. Launch the deployment/service
    1. Apply the .yaml info to Kubernetes: `./bash_test_kubectl.sh deploy`
    2. Wait for the pods to be ready: `./bash_displayer.sh`
    3. Test on localhost/80

4. Bonus:
    1. If the tunnel is still active, run: `minikube dashboard`
